# Chen_HeyDay

Hey Day this year will happen on Oct.14.2020! Please try running this little program that gives you a virtual Hey Day experience.

**What Is Hey Day?**

The tradition dated all the way back to World War II. HEY DAY started when Auburn University’s student body and members of the Student Government Association pushed for a day that would bring the Auburn Family closer together and make everyone feel involved. Each year on this special day, the Auburn Family are encouraged to greet one another with the Auburn Spirit!

**What Happens on Hey Day?**

There will be Hey Day name tags handed out on multiple sites on campus, and digital name tags will be available for download and print on [this website](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/). You can put your name on it and wear it around campus. Go ahead and greet others when you see their names on a name tag, and you'll find others saying hey back to you!
